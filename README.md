# Ray-Tracing-implementation-in-Python
Ray Tracing implementation in Python.

The implementation uses external libraries only for faster calculation and not for the implementation itself.

Most of the code is Linear Algebra calculations combined with Physics to approximate the colors of a scene.

Scenes can be manually created using a text document that is later parsed in the code to indentify relevant objects and interpret the scene.
